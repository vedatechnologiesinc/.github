# Veda Technologies, Inc.

👋️ Hello, there! We're a software company that's pushing the boundaries of what
can be solved through computational means and with the current advancements of
machines.

☯️️ You can find in this page open source software that we wrote and we use
ourselves in our build and development systems. We primarily use
[Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org), [Haskell](https://haskell.org), and [Nix](https://nixos.org).

❄️️ We use [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and
[NixOS](https://nixos.org)—on aarch64, x86_64, and arm64—as our primary
development systems and we deploy on macOS; GNU/Linux; and on the web.

🐚️️️ Our engineer(s) love to write (and talk) about random things, and they can be
found at [ebzzry.com](https://ebzzry.com).

🧠 The [white paper](https://github.com/vedatechnologiesinc/white-paper/blob/main/white-paper.pdf?raw=true)
talks about approaches on how to reach some of the low-hanging fruits of general
intelligence based on computationalism.

🏄️️️ Our headquarters is based in the tropical province of [La Union, Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Union).

🦑 You can find more about us [on our website](https://veda-tech.com).
